UPGRADE:
So we have an upgrade header which can  be used to upgrade an already existing client/server connection to a different protocol over same transport protocol.
Eg. http1.1 to http 1.2 or http to https or http to websocket.


WebSocket : 
It is computer communication protocol providing full duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
It starts as an HTTP request (the WebSocket handshake) and then upgrades to the WebSocket protocol.
WebSocket requires direct access to the underlying server instance, which Express abstracts away.
Once the connection is upgraded, the protocol switches from HTTP to the WebSocket protocol.



Express.js:
Web framework of Node.js to simplify building applications and API, especialy server side development .
Express.js runs on Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
It is a framework built over many modules including HTTP to simplify routing for HTTP requests.
